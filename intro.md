## History

### Gnu

* GNU is an operating system that is free softwareâ€”that is, it respects users' freedom.

* **What is Free Software?**
    * The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
    * The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
    * The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
    * The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
